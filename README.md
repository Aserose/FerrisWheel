# FerrisWheel (ENG)

**«FerrisWheel»** is a telegram bot. The main function of the bot is collection of images indexed by date and geo-data from electronic sources - if it's publicly available, of course. 
The address can be specified in any common language of the world. And besides that, there is an option to search by time: either until a certain date, or some interval.
The search is currently only includes the vk social network.

The bot also has a blacklist function - if the user does not want to see images of a certain author, then he can add him to the blacklist and they will not be displayed anymore.

Although the application is functional, in its current state it still requires some major architectural fixes. So instead of fixing it, I decided to create a new and more user-friendly application with similar features.
