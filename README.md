# FerrisWheel

FerrisWheel is the bot for Telegram. The main function of the bot is to search for photos by address where they were taken - if it's publicly available, of course. 
The address can be specified in any common language of the world. And besides that, there is an option to search by time: either until a certain date, or some interval.
The search is currently only includes the vk social network.

The bot also has a blacklist function - if the user does not want to see images of a certain author, then he can add him to the blacklist and they will not be displayed anymore.
